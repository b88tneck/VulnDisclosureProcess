    <h1>Vulnerability Disclosure Process</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>(Add an introduction to the organisation.)</p>
    <p>This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering 
      reporting to us (the "Organisation"). We recommend reading this vulnerability
      disclosure policy fully before you report a vulnerability and always acting in
      compliance with it.</p>
      
    <p>We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities
      according to this policy. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability
      disclosures.</p>
      <h2>Reporting</h2>
      <p>(Add an introduction to the organisation.)
        If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to us
        using the following online form OR via email:</p>
        
      <ul>
        <li>Contact: mailto:security@example.com</li>
        <li>Online Form: https://<<INSERT-URI>>.com</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>In any correspondence, please include details of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The website, IP or page where the vulnerability can be observed.</li>
        <li>A brief description of the type of vulnerability, for example; “XSS vulnerability”.</li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce. These should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept (no
        sensitive information. This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and
        accurately. It also reduces the likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation
        of some vulnerabilities, such as sub-domain takeovers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 5 working
        days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days. We’ll also aim to keep you
        informed of our progress.</p>
        
        <p>Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity and exploit
          complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are
          welcome to enquire on the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14
          days. This allows our teams to focus on the remediation.</p>
        
        <p>We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be
        invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.
        Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report.
        We’d like to unify guidance to affected users, so please do continue to coordinate
        public release with us.</p>
      <h2>Guidance</h2>
      <p>You must NOT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Break any applicable law or regulations.</li> 
        <li>Access unnecessary, excessive or significant amounts of data.</li>*
        <li>Modify data in the Organisation's systems or services.</li>
        <li>Use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.</li>* 
        <li>Attempt or report any form of denial of service, e.g. overwhelming a service with a
          high volume of requests.</li>
        <li>Disrupt the Organisation's services or systems.</li>
        <li>Submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that
          the services do not fully align with “best practice”, for example missing security
          headers.</li>
        <li>Submit reports detailing TLS configuration weaknesses, for example “weak” cipher
          suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support.</li>
        <li>Communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described
          in the published security.txt.</li>
        <li>Social engineer, ‘phish’ or physically attack the Organisation's staff or
          infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Demand financial compensation in order to disclose any vulnerabilities.</li>* 
        
        <p>You must:</p>
        <li>Always comply with data protection rules and must not violate the privacy of the
          Organisation’s users, staff, contractors, services or systems. You must not, for
          example, share, redistribute or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems
          or services.</li>
        <li>Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer
          required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first
          (or as otherwise required by data protection law).</li>
      </ul>
        
      <h1>Guidance</h1>
      <p>This policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability disclosure good
        practice. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent
        with the law, or which might cause the Organisation or partner organisations to be in
        breach of any legal obligations.</p>
